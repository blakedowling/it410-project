Project Proposal
Within the first few weeks of class we'll take time to discuss the project you'd like to work on. The purpose of this is two fold:

To help you create a project that is not too large and not too small.
To answer any questions you have about your project.
Grading Criteria
The grade for your final project is based on a presentation that will occur on one of the last two days of class. There is no extra credit for presenting the first day, but if any team fails to present they will receive a 0% on their final project.

The presentation should include a demonstration of the web application as well as some code examples. The following criteria will be used to grade your final project.

Attendance (5%) - You must be there both days (one day to present, the other to see presentations).

Database Usage (15%) - You must have your own database for storing data and your web application should read from and write to that database. (Show some code.)

REST API (15%) - You must have a REST endpoint for making a request that writes to the database and you must have a REST endpoint for making a request that reads from the database. (Show some code.)

Dynamic Pages (15%) - You must have at least one front end page that has significant updates via AJAX calls. For example, a simple message that shows "Save Completed" after saving to the database does not constitute a significant update. A significant update would include a chat interface, single page app routing, multiple dynamic screen updates based on user interaction, etc. (Show through demonstration.)

Session Management (15%) - Users must be able to log into your system and remain logged in while navigating the site and during page reloads. Logout must also be available. (Show through demonstration.)

Polish (15%) - I don't expect you to be a UI or UX expert, but I do expect the front end application to make sense and be usable without special instruction. (Show through demonstration.)

Project Scope (15%) - Don't make your project too small. If you have questions about what is too small be sure to ask me. (Show through demonstration.)

Reward and Challenge (5%) - Share with the class what the most rewarding part of the project was as well as the most challenging.
